    <th>Traditional Home  The Usual Way We Live
In a traditional home, everything is done by hand. You switch on the lights using a button, you lock the doors with a key, and you control your fan or AC manually. Even small things like opening curtains or turning off appliances you have to do it on your own.  There’s no remote control, no phone app, and no voice commands. You have to be present at home to control things.
