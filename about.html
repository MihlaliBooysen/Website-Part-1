    <th>Traditional Home  The Usual Way We Live
In a traditional home, everything is done by hand. You switch on the lights using a button, you lock the doors with a key, and you control your fan or AC manually. Even small things like opening curtains or turning off appliances you have to do it on your own.  Thereâ€™s no remote control, no phone app, and no voice commands. You have to be present at home to control things.
